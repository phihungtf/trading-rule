# Introduction

- A trade occurs when people agree on a price but disagree on the expected value of an asset
- Humans tend to distill complex phenomena into simple rules
- Technical analysis assumes market conditions repeat over time, making rules applicable
- The trend is your friend - trend analysis is a basic tenet of technical analysis

## What we will be introducing

We will investigate a simple trading rule and then develop that trading rule using an unsupervised machine learning technique to improve it.

- Discuss the trading rule that we want to investigate
- Acquire the data to test this trading rule
- Look at heuristic and machine learning constructs to improve upon the simple rule
