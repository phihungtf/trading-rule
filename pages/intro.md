# Introduction

- A trade occurs when people agree on a price but disagree on the expected value of an asset
- Humans tend to distill complex phenomena into simple rules
- Technical analysis assumes market conditions repeat over time, making rules applicable
- The trend is your friend - trend analysis is a basic tenet of technical analysis

# Transition to Technical Solutions

- While these memes are humorous, they highlight real challenges in trading.
- Letâ€™s explore how machine learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can help us develop better trading strategies.

## What will be introducing

We will investigate a simple trading rule and then develop that trading rule using an unsupervised machine learning technique to improve it.

<div className="flex justify-between items-center">
    <div className="flex-3">
        <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-10 text-xl">
        <li>Discuss the trading rule that we want to investigate</li>
        <li>Acquire the data to test this trading rule</li>
        <li>Look at heuristic and machine learning constructs to improve upon the simple rule</li>
        </ul>
