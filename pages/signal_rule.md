# Simple Trading Rule
**Using 20-day, 50-day, 200-day Moving Averages**

- 20-day MA: Captures short-term trends (information trades)
- 50-day MA: Captures medium-term trends (quarterly data, earnings)
- 200-day MA: Captures long-term trends (buy-and-hold strategy)

**Buy Signal**: 20-day MA > 50-day MA\
**Golden Buy Signal**: 20-day MA > 50-day MA > 200-day MA\
_Strong Buy for 30-day holding period_\
\
**Sell Signal**: 20-day MA < 50-day MA\
**Death Sell Signal**: 20-day MA < 50-day MA < 200-day MA\
_Strong Sell for 30-day holding period_
- Combination of 3 MAs gives a robust estimate of the trend term
